## Unit 18 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers
  This assignment was to add functionality to the existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user is able to use the app offline and when its back online, the entries are still in the tracker.

### Cache
  The screenshot below shows the files that will be cached if the app goes offline. The data in the files will be temporarily stored allowing for a quicker reload when the page is revisited by the user.
